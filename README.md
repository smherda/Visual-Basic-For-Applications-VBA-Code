# Python-Example-Code

This folder contains example code used for projects that I have worked on and were built using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Some scripts might need others that are not present due to discretionary reasons. Some are saved as text files that can be put into macros. 
 
## Installation
 
Make sure to have Visual Basic for Applications installed in Excel and macros enabled. 
  
## Usage
 
To be used for evaluating previously coded scripts as well as potentially providing feedback.
